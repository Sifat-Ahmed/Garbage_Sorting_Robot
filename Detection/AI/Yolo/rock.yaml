## path to the images folder
## and you have to make sure that the "labels" folder is also in the same directory

## that means if images are like this : home/some_root/path1/images
## then labels path should be: home/some_root/path1/labels

## home/some_root/path1/ this needs to be same for images and labels
## Understood thank you for the clarification

## same for val

## so you can copy in the directory of this folder or put path of your folder, both are okay
## Just to keep everything orginized I will keep it with the yolo5-61 or what ever its called folder
## that or the new folder you made

## whichever you like, np for me ai ai sir


##### This is the command, change the epoch and batch size(gpu can't handle large ones),
## will just watch to guide you

## Sorry about that was gona ask that the more epoch the better from what I read and was gona ask until what point.
## So I am guessing from what u mentioned that 100 is the max this gpu can handle?

## you can put infinite number of epochs (I prefer 100, shi prefers 30/50ish) but for batch size we have 24gb mem
## so gpu can handle 34 images (max) in one batch if I remember correctly. That means it can process 34 images with size 640 and 3 color channels
## in one batch, anything higher than that gives cuda out of memory

## Yea I had the same issue when trying to run tensor flow on my 1080, had to bring down the array size to fit the epoch.
## Something about how the model is trained which over loads the GPU memory did not really get the explanation but I get
## The Idea, so I will use 100 for now. Okay I will try to run it then.


## CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 python train.py --img 640 --epochs 100 --batch 40 --data rock.yaml --weights ''  --cfg yolov5l.yaml --patience 0

## This is the command you mentioned right? To start training the model?yeah


## if you start training, all the outputs will be saved in runs/train/exp8, next time exp9.. exp10 and goes on

train: dataset/train/images
val: dataset/val/images

## image directory only
## but the root folder should also contain the labels

nc: 1

names: ['ROCK']


# Okay that should be enough for validation

## cOOL EASY AS PIE

## another thing, if you want to re-train the model, you need tje previous weight file

## CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 python train.py --img 640 --epochs 100 --batch 40 --data rock.yaml --weights 'runs/train/exp8/weights/best.pt'  --cfg yolov5l.yaml --patience 0


## once you finish this training, it will be saved in exp8. Next time exp9/ So if you want to re0train the model, you need to change the weight path
## at the moment its blank, because we have started from scratch

## Got it thank you, will it take less time to retrain or is it about the same.

## you don't need to retrain for 100 epochs. 20 will do, so less time
## work of art hahaha, got it so put more images then change the 100 to 20 for retraining
## Thank you sifat
